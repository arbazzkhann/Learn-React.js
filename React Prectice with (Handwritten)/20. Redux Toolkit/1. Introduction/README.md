* Can be uses with React JS, Angular JS or any other javascript Liabrary/Frameworks.
* Redux is predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Redux Core Components

**Store** - Holds states of your application.
**Action** - Describe the changes in the state of applications.
**Reducer** - Actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.
              Accept the Action and perform some operations.

* ✅ The entire state of your application is stored in a single JavaScript object, called the store.
* ✅ Only way to change the state is to **emit an action**, an object describing what happened.
