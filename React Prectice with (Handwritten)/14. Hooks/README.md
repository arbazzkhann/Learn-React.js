# Hooks
* Hooks are **special functions** in react that let you use features like state, context, effect in functional components (without using classes).

## Why use hooks?
* Write **cleaner** and **shorter** code.
* No need to write class components.
* Easy to **reuse logic**.
* Helps to make your components more powerful.

## React hooks?
* **useState**: To **create** and **Manage state**.
* **useEffect**: To Run code on **mount**, **update**, or **unmount**.
* **useRef**: To **access DOM** or **Store values**.
* **useContext**: To **share data between components** easily.
* **useMemo**: To **optimize performance**, **avoid re-creating functions**.
* **useRender**: To **Manage complex state** logic (like redux).
